And if our actions are governed by our feelings, this means that we, having relieved ourselves of responsibility, allowed them to do it.  The friend was happy, but within reasonable limits, for he really learned to love without conditions.  And that I loved him as perhaps no one else in the world.  Once I shared with this friend the principle according to which it is necessary thatwhat was important to the other person was just as important to you as the person was to you.  It is listed sequentially in the book and, at the end of each skill description,is provided with how-tos so you can take a closer look at any of the skills individually whenever you want.  Everyone else is focused on details, particulars, and I see the whole picture as a whole.  This ability allows us to learn not only from our own, but also from other people's experience.

Once, when he had been working at the university for several months, I went to his office with a request to do some urgent matters that were bothering me.  2.
